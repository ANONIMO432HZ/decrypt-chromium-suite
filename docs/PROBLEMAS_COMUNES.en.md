# Common Troubleshooting (English)

This document outlines frequent issues encountered during the build and obfuscation of the project and how to resolve them.

---

## 1. PyArmor: The term 'pyarmor' is not recognized

### Symptom
Attempting to run `pyarmor` results in an error message indicating the command is not recognized.

### Cause
This typically happens for two reasons:
1. The Python scripts directory (e.g., `C:\Python314\Scripts\`) is not correctly added to the system PATH.
2. The PyArmor installation preferred the direct CLI module instead of creating a global executable.

### Solution (Using build.py)
To prevent manual errors and PATH issues, use the included automation script:
```powershell
python build.py --name "AppName"
```

Alternatively, use the direct module entry point:
```powershell
python -m pyarmor.cli --version
```

## 2. Syntax Error in `pyarmor pack` (Version Incompatibility)

### Symptom
Receiving error messages for unknown arguments or commands when using `pyarmor pack`, following older tutorials.

### Cause
You have installed **PyArmor 8.x or 9.x**, where the bundling workflow changed significantly compared to version 7. The `pack` command no longer exists in its previous form, and arguments have been restructured.

### Solution for PyArmor 9+
Use the `gen --pack` command. Below is the equivalent to `--onefile --noconsole`:

1. **Configure PyInstaller Options**:
   Set the executable name and console flags in PyArmor's local configuration:
   ```powershell
   python -m pyarmor.cli cfg pack:pyi_options="--onefile --noconsole --name SysHealth"
   ```

2. **Run Execution/Bundle**:
   Generate the obfuscated bundle using the `--pack` flag:
   ```powershell
   python -m pyarmor.cli gen --pack onefile main.py
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   The output produced will be in the `dist/` directory. Note that if using the **Trial version**, there are limits on script complexity and obfuscation.

## 3. Report not sent (Network Error)

### Symptom
The script finishes but you do not receive the message on Telegram or Discord.

### Cause
Internet micro-outages, unstable DNS, or temporary rate-limiting by the APIs.

### Solution
The suite implements automatic **network resilience** using a retry decorator (3 attempts with exponential backoff). If it fails after all retries, the script **will not delete** the local report file (even if `--no-wipe` is not used) to ensure the audit data is not lost. You can manually recover the report from the `.audit/` folder.

---

## 4. Console window briefly appears at startup (Stealth Mode)

### Symptom
When running the script or `.exe` with `-s` / `--stealth`, the command window is visible for a second before hiding.

### Cause
Console hiding is deferred until after argument parsing and module imports. This prevents the script from dying silently in the background if a critical library (like `pywin32`) is missing on the target PC.

### Solution
This is a design choice to ensure robustness. If you need it to be 100% invisible from millisecond zero, you must compile using `python build.py --noconsole`.

## 5. Passwords show strange symbols or `[AES-GCM Error]`

### Symptom
In the HTML/CSV report, the password field shows strange characters, or values like `[AES-GCM Error]`, `[No AES Key]`, or `[Not Decrypted]`.

### Cause
Chromium uses **two different encryption schemes** that can coexist in the same profile database:

1. **AES-GCM (v80+)**: Blobs have the `v10` prefix and require the master key from the `Local State` file.
2. **DPAPI Legacy (<v80)**: Blobs encrypted directly by Windows, with no prefix.

The error markers indicate:

| Marker | Cause |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[No AES Key]` | `v10` blob but `Local State` could not be read. |
| `[Invalid Blob]` | The `v10` blob is truncated or corrupt. |
| `[AES-GCM Error]` | The key exists but does not decrypt this blob (and DPAPI also failed). |
| `[Not Decrypted]` | Legacy blob without prefix that DPAPI cannot decrypt in this session. |

### Solution
1. Run with **Administrator** permissions to ensure DPAPI can access the current user's keys.
2. If the browser is open, use **`--auto-kill`** to close the process and release the database lock.
3. If you see `[No AES Key]`, the profile's `Local State` might be corrupt or belong to another Windows user.

## 6. "Permission Denied" Error when deleting logs or reports

### Symptom
The Dashboard or script fails when trying to clean the `.audit/` folder or the `pentest_audit.log` file.

### Cause
Windows blocks files that another process is writing to. If an audit failed halfway, the log handler might have remained open.

### Solution
1. Ensure no other instance is running (check Task Manager).
2. The suite includes a "Logger Guard" that closes streams before attempting to delete. If the problem persists, restart the application.

---

## 7. Self-Destruct did not delete the .exe

### Symptom
You activated `--self-destruct` but the file remains in the folder after execution.

### Cause
The Windows `del` command can fail if the file is locked by:
1. Windows Explorer (if you have the folder open and the file selected).
2. An Antivirus scanning the binary at that moment.

### Solution
Wait a few seconds. The command has a 3s delay to allow the main process to exit before deleting itself. Avoid having the output folder open in Explorer during testing.

---

## 8. Chrome does not detect profiles even though they are installed (`0 profiles found`)

### Symptom
The log shows `Found 0 profiles to process.` but you have Chrome installed with saved passwords.

### Possible Cause 1 — Profile not detected by name
The detector looks for folders named `Default`, `Guest Profile`, or `Profile N`. If your profile has another name (rare, but possible in modified installations), it won't be found.

### Possible Cause 2 — Empty database
The suite validates that the `Login Data` file has `size > 0`. A newly created profile or one without saved passwords has an empty DB and is discarded.

### Possible Cause 3 — Browser locking the DB
Chrome has an exclusive lock on `Login Data` while it is running.

### Solution
- Activate **`--auto-kill`** (or the equivalent option in the Builder) to close the browser before auditing.
- Manually verify that the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data` folder exists and is not empty.

---

## 9. "Database is locked" Error (SQLite)

### Symptom
Even using `--auto-kill`, the log shows that the `Login Data` database is locked and cannot be copied.

### Cause
This typically occurs when a cloud synchronization service (like **OneDrive**, **Google Drive**, or **Dropbox**) is attempting to back up the browser profile at that exact moment, keeping a handle open on the file.

### Solution
1. Temporarily pause cloud file synchronization.
2. If the problem persists, check for "orphan" Chrome or Edge processes in Task Manager that `--auto-kill` might have missed (sometimes happens with extension sub-processes).

---

## 10. Heuristic Detection (AV False Positives)

### Symptom
Your obfuscated and signed binary is deleted by the Antivirus immediately after being generated or when attempting to run it.

### Cause
The combination of **bundling (PyInstaller)** + **obfuscation (PyArmor)** + **network behavior (Webhooks)** is a pattern that AVs flag as suspicious by default (heuristic detection).

### Solution
1. **Don't use the default name**: Change the filename to something generic like `WinSystemTray.exe`.
2. **Change the Icon**: Using the default Python icon is an immediate red flag. Use one from a known application.
3. **Increase Initial Delay**: Set a delay of at least 30-60 seconds in the Builder. Many AV sandboxes give up if they see no activity in the first few seconds.
4. **Metadata Spoofing**: Make sure to fill in the Version, Company, and Description fields in the Builder to make the binary look legitimate.

---

## 11. Dashboard won't open (ModuleNotFoundError)

### Symptom
When running `python gui_app.py`, you receive an error saying that the `customtkinter` or `PIL` module cannot be found.

### Cause
GUI dependencies are missing from your current environment.

### Solution
Install the full set of dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If the error persists specifically with `PIL` (Pillow), reinstall it manually:
```powershell
pip install --force-reinstall Pillow
```

## 12. Chrome shows "Not Decrypted" (App-Bound Encryption v20)

### Symptom
In recent versions of Chrome (127+), all passwords appear as `[Not Decrypted]`, while other browsers like Edge or Brave (if not updated) show them correctly.

### Cause
Starting with **Chrome 127** (July 2024), Google introduced **App-Bound Encryption**. Passwords now use the **`v20`** prefix instead of the classic `v10`.
- **v10/v11**: Uses an AES key encrypted with DPAPI. Any user process can ask Windows to decrypt it.
- **v20**: The key is tied to the identity of the `chrome.exe` executable. Google uses a Windows service (`Chrome Elevation Service`) that verifies the entity requesting decryption is the legitimate browser.

### How to verify your version
1. In Chrome, go to `chrome://version`.
2. If the version is **127.x** or higher, you are almost certainly using `v20`.
3. You can verify the blobs directly in the database: if they start with the bytes `76 32 30` (ASCII: `v20`), it is the new encryption.

### Solution
Currently, decrypting `v20` from external processes is extremely complex as it requires code injection into the Chrome process or interacting with the elevation service under specific conditions. The suite detects these blobs but cannot decrypt them due to limitations imposed by the Operating System and process identity.
